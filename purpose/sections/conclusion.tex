\section*{Future Directions}
My prior work has focused on using Bayesian optimization as a tool to steer research in machine learning. This is valuable for fundamental research and has led to progress in molecular dynamics simulations \cite{Bhomik2018Clustering} and natural language processing \cite{Gao2017HAN}. However, as machine learning algorithms become more ubiquitous, I believe there is an increasing need to incorporate human feedback these systems.
