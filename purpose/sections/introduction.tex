\section*{Introduction}
I believe that there is great value in considering the human experience as the process of learning in an ever changing world. Learning, it seems, is fundamental to the human condition. And yet we find ourselves hard pressed to fully explain the process of learning. I find it incredible that the process through which we come to understand the world can at once seem so intimate and so mysterious. Further, considering how vast and complicated the universe can be, it amazes me that we are able to make sense of it at all.

I am broadly interested in algorithms for sequential decision making under uncertainty.
