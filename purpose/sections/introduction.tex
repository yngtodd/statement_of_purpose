\section*{Introduction}
I believe that there is great value in considering the human experience as the process of learning in an ever changing world. Learning, it seems, is fundamental to the human condition. And yet we find ourselves hard pressed to fully explain learning. I find it incredible that the process through which we come to understand the world can at once seem so intimate and so mysterious. 

Of course humanity is not the sole possessor of learning faculties. Contemporary society is filled with learning algorithms that shape society in deep ways. 

I am broadly interested in algorithms for sequential decision making under uncertainty.
